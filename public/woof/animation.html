      We're going to explore how to give sprites multiple costumes and swap between them. For this project, we're just going to be making a simple animation, but there are lots of ways to use this pattern.

    <div class="block">
      1) Chose costumes for your sprite. If you are creating your own (or using costumes from a sprite sheet you like), it's best to have each costume be a similar size. Upload each costume as a separate sprite.

    <div class="block">
      2) Make a list that contains all the URLs for the costumes of your sprite.
    </div>
    <div class="block">
      3) Make a variable that keeps track of which costume in the list you'd like to display. Make a text sprite to display this variable.

    </div>
    <div class="block">
      4) Make your variable cycle through the costume numbers by adding 1 to it every second. When your variable reaches the length of the list, set it back to 0. (Since Woof is Zero-Indexed, we use '0' to refer to the first item in a list).

    </div>
    <div class="block">
      5) Each time your variable changes, get the appropriate URL from your list and use it to change your sprite's costume. (You can also speed up the animation by changing how often the variable changes)

      6) (Bonus) Add movement, and only advance the animation when the player is moving.
