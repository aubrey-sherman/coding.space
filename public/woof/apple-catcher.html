		<p>In this project, we're going to make a game where a character has to collect falling dots before they touch the ground. The coolest part: if you do the challenge step, the game will even work on mobile! </p>

	<div class="block">
		<p>1) Create two sprites: your character sprite and a sprite for your character to catch. </p>

	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>2) Make your character move left and right when the left and right arrow keys are pressed. </p>

	</div>

	<div class="block">
		<p>3) Make the sprite that will be caught start at a random point along the top of the screen.</p>

	<div class="block">
		<p>4) Have that sprite fall.</p>

	</div>

	<div class="block">
		<p>5) If the catchable sprite touches the character, have it go back to another random spot at the top of the screen and fall again.</p>

	<div class="block">
		<p>6) If the catchable sprite hits the bottom of the screen, have the game end. Make the screen show "Game Over." </p>

	<div class="block">
		<p>7) Make a scoreboard. The score should go up whenever the character sprite catches the other sprite. </p>

	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<p>8) Make a level counter. If your character catches a certain number of sprites, reset the score to 0 and make the level go up by one. </p>

		<p>9) As the levels increases, make the game harder by making the catchable sprites fall faster. </p>

		<p>10) Challenge: Since your phone doesn't have arrow keys, you'll need a new way to get the character sprite to move. How can you adapt this game so that it will work mobile? </p>
