		<p> 1) Select a background for your course, pick a location for the hole, and a starting place for your ball. </p>

		<p> 2) Create walls and other obstacles for your course, like a sand pit. (Tip: Be creative! You can add moving obstacles, water hazards, lasers, etc. The sky's the limit! ) </p>

		<p>5) When the mouse is released, have the line disappear and have the ball travel in the direction of the line. (Tip: in addition to moving in the right directions, the ball should move faster or slower depending on the length of the line) </p>

		<p>7) Make sure the ball slows down as it travels across the screen, just like a real golf ball does in grass. (Bonus: Can you make the ball slow down faster if it's in a sandpit or some other obstacle?) </p>
