        1) Before you get started, take a look at our basic instruction for working with Woof and Firebase. Look through  Google's <a  target="_blank" href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup">Firebase Setup Guide</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/read-and-write">Instructions for working with the Firebase database.</a>
    </div>
    <div class="block">
        2) Write your game and test it to make sure it works well without the High Score first.
    </div>
    <div class="block">
        3) Wrap all your game code in a function, called <code>runGame()</code>. <br> Below the <code>runGame()</code> function, call
        <code>runGame()</code> to run the game. <br> Make sure that your game works as before.
    </div>
    <div class="block">
        4) Replace the call to runGame with the following code:<br><br>
        <pre>importCodeURL("https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/3.4.0/firebase.js", runGame)</pre>This loads the Firebase libraries before running your game. <br> Make sure your game still works as before.
    </div>
    <div class="block">
        5) Create an account on Google Firebase and open a new project.
    </div>
    <div class="block">
        6) Change the Rules on the database by clicking on "Database" then "RULES", then "LEARN MORE" in the Console.<br>
        <br><br>

        <br><br>
        <br> Then choose "PUBLIC" from the example rule sets.
        <br><br>
        <img src="./images/public_rules_fb.png">
        <br><br> Replace the rules for your project with the PUBLIC rules. This will allow your game code to read and write freely to the database.
    </div>
    <div class="block">
        7) Go to the Firebase console, choose "Add Firebase to your web app."
        <br><br>

        <br><br> Firebase will generate the config code for your project.
        <br><br>
        <img src="./images/Firebase_config_Copy.png">
        <br><br> Highlight the config code between the second set of
        < script> tags (starting with "// Initialize Firebase"), copy and paste it into your project.
    </div>
    <div class="block">
        8) Create score and highScore variables. Inside a forever loop in your game code, check to see if score is higher than highScore, and if so, write the score value to the sharedHighScore location in the database using this line of code:<br><br>
        <pre>firebase.database().ref(“sharedHighScore”).set(score)</pre>
    </div>
    <div class="block" style="text-align:left">
        9) In the initialization section of your game, setup the highScore variable to read from the database sharedHighScore location using the following code:
        <pre>firebase.database().ref("sharedHighScore").on("value", function (snapshot) {
  highScore = snapshot.val();
});</pre>
    </div>
    <div class="block">
        10) Add a text label to display the high score in the game.
    </div>
    <div class="block">
        11) Test your game and fix any bugs. Then play your game and get the high score to see if the high score is showing properly. Enjoy!
