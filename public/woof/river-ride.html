		<p>Let's take a ride down the river! Collect coconuts, avoid gators, and stay ahead of the current. Race against time or an opponent! </p>

		<p>1) Create the look of your game. Add a backdrop, trees, grass&mdash;whatever you like. Most importantly, create a river! Search for images on Google, use shapes in Woof, or head on over to <a target="_blank" href="https://pixlr.com/editor">Pixlr</a> (or another image editor) and create something there. Note: If you create your own image, you'll then need to host it somewhere like <a target="_blank" href="https://postimage.io">Postimage</a>.</p>

		<p>2) Give your river a downward current. Have the current get faster over time.</p>

	<div class="block">
		<p>3) Create two character sprites and place them at the bottom of the screen. Make one move with the arrow keys and the other with the  A, W, S, and D keys.</p>

	<div class="block">
		<p>6) Create objects for the character sprites to collect as they move upstream. Have the objects appear every so often in random places and float down the river. </p>

		<p>8) Create obstacles for your characters to avoid. Have them appear every so often in random places and move in different directions as they float downstream. Have them speed up over time.</p>

		<p>9) If a character touches an obstacle, make the obstacle disappear and decrease that player's score. Send the character back to the bottom of the screen.</p>

		<p>10) If a character sprite touches the outer edges of the river, create a collision effect and bring the sprite back to the middle of the river. Set its score to 0.</p>

		<div class="block">
		<p>12) Add text at the beginning of the game. Have it explain how to play the game and ask if the player wants to add music. Find an audio file to play if the answer is yes! </p>

		<p>13) Challenge: Create an option for a one-player game and have the player race against a timer. Add a choice of one player or two players at the start and update your game as needed.</p>
