      Let's make a trivia game that uses questions from an online resource. We'll be using the <a target="_blank" href="https://opentdb.com/api_config.php">Open Trivia Database</a> to generate questions, and use them in our project.

    </div>
    <div class="block">
      1) For now, let's generate a single multiple choice question in any category. Have the API website generate an API URL, and save that URL as a variable in your project.
    </div>
    <div class="block">
      2) We're going to use <code>getData</code> to get information from this URL. Once Woof has received the data, print it out in the console.

    </div>
    <div class="block">
      3) Explore the data in your console, which requires Inspecting the page. You'll probably need to expand out the data to see how it is organized. It will likely look something like:
      <img src="./images/TriviaData.png">
    </div>
    <div class="block">
      4) Make a text sprite that displays the question's text. You'll need to follow the data's organization from the console to properly display the question.

    </div>
    <div class="block">
      5) Display the choices for the multiple choice question. (Hint: The correct answer is stored in a separate field from the incorrect answers)

    </div>
    <div class="block">
      6) If the right answers are clicked, celebrate the correct choice!

    </div>
    <div class="block">
      7) If the wrong answers are clicked, indicate they are wrong.

    </div>
    <div class="block">
      8) (Challenge) Include more than one question. You should modify the API URL to retrieve multiple questions at once, and may want to write a function that sets up the sprites for a question.
