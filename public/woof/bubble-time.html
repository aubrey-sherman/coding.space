		<p>It's bubble time! Blow as many bubbles as you like and pop them with your mouse to catch the cool prizes inside. Collect the prizes in your container and watch out for bubble invaders trying to spoil the fun.</p>

		<p>2) Make your character move left and right with two keys on your keyboard. ('A' and 'D' are used in the demo.) If your character reaches the edge of the screen, keep it from going off the screen. </p>

		<p>7) Make  an undesirable object come out of the bubbles, too. Make it is so that there is a 50% chance of having the fun thing come out or the not-so-fun thing.</p>

		<p>9) Create a container sprite to put the objects in. Have your character put the objects in the container when you press a key. ('Down' is used in the demo.) Make it so the character can only put the object in the container when it is within a certain distance of it.</p>
