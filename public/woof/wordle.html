		<p>In this project, we'll be recreating Wordle in Woof! </p>

		<p>1) Copy the code in this demo to get word lists. Randomly choose an answer to work towards.</p>

		<p>2) Create squares (6 rows with 5 in each row) to hold the letters that we'll make. (Hint: explore the repeat documentation to automate producing all the squares) </p>

	</div>
	<div class="block">

		<p>3) When a letter key is pressed, have that letter show up in the first square. (Hint: look at the keysDown list to avoid having to write an if statement for each letter) It might also be helpful to have a variable keeping track of the letters in the current guess. </p>

	<div class="block">

		<p>4) Use variables to keep track of where you should put the next letter. Modify your code that creates letters to put newly created letters in the appropriate square. </p>

		<p>6) When the enter key is pressed, check if a valid 5 letter word is entered, and display an error if not. </p>

	<div class="block">

		<p>7)  Check each letter of the guess against the answer, and indicate correct letters by changing the color of the square. (Hint: look for substring in the documentation to get individual letters from the answer/guess) </p>

		<p>8) For any letters that aren't correct, determine if it is mis-positioned (yellow) or not present (gray). </p>

		<p>9) If all the letters are correct, congratulate the player and prevent them from entering any more letters. </p>

		<p>Bonus) Add a clickable keyboard at the bottom of the screen as a mobile-friendly alternative to typing your words. Update the colors of the keys based on the know information.</p>
